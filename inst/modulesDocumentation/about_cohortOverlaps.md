## About cohort overlaps 

An **UpSet plot** is a data visualization method used to display intersections of sets and their sizes. It is an alternative to Venn diagrams, particularly effective for visualizing complex overlaps between multiple sets. In an UpSet plot, the intersections are represented by dots and lines on the x-axis, and the corresponding set sizes are shown as bars on the y-axis, making it easy to compare the size of each intersection and the individual set sizes.

The UpSet plot is particularly useful for visualizing overlaps between multiple cohorts, such as patients with different diseases or conditions. It can help identify commonalities and differences between the cohorts, and highlight the relationships between them. This can be useful for understanding the relationships between different diseases, identifying shared risk factors, or exploring the impact of different treatments or interventions on different patient populations.
